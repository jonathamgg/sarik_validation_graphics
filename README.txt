Project Description
This repository contains the data and scripts used in the validation and analysis 
of performance metrics in a distributed environment, aiming at the study of security
and optimization of IoT systems. Next, we will describe the organization of files and folders in this repository.

Folder "validation"
The "validation" folder contains the raw data generated by the scripts for each evaluated metric. Within this folder, you will find subfolders corresponding to each metric, such as "latency," "response rate," and "transmission rate." Each of these subfolders contains data generated by the script executed on different days and test groups. The data files in these folders show the time spent in seconds for a specific action in each execution.

Folder "merge"
The "merge" folder contains files resulting from the concatenation of the raw data from the "validation" subfolders. These files combine the data from groups 1 and 2 into a single file, facilitating the analysis and comparison of results.

Folder "DATA"
The "DATA" folder contains several scripts that perform procedures to calculate the average time per day and generate a new file containing these average values. These scripts are essential for obtaining a more comprehensive and summarized view of the collected data.

Folder "Charts"
The "Charts" folder contains the graphs generated from the average time of the experiments. These graphs provide a clear and informative visualization of the performance of the evaluated systems.

Folder "Statistical Calculation"
The "Statistical Calculation" folder contains PDF files generated by the jamovi software for performing statistical calculations on the collected data. These files provide valuable information about the statistical analysis conducted in the experiments.

Folder "Monitoring"
The "Monitoring" folder contains .yaml files for data collection and visualization using the Prometheus and Grafana software. These files offer an effective approach to monitor and analyze real-time system performance.

Feel free to explore the files and folders in this repository for more information about the experiments conducted and the results obtained. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
jamovi software (for statistical analysis)
Python packages: pandas, matplotlib, numpy

How to Use
1 - Clone this repository to your local machine.
