This repository contains data and scripts related to experiments conducted for metric analysis.
The purpose of this readme is to provide an overview of the files and scripts available in this repository.

Folder Structure

Raw Data: In this folder, you will find the raw data generated during the experiments. 
The raw data is divided into two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Each group contains subfolders 
corresponding to the days of the experiments.

Data Processing: Here, you will find a script that performs the processing of the raw data. 
This script is responsible for merging the data from Group 1 and Group 2 into a single file 
with two columns: group and tested variable. Additionally, the script removes unnecessary 
rows and replaces collected characters with others.

Processed Data: In this folder, you will find the resulting file from the data processing. 
The file contains the processed data and is ready for further analysis.

Using the Data Processing Script
To use the data processing script, follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have the raw data in the correct folder.
Execute the data processing script, specifying the path to the raw data files.
The script will process the data and generate the file with the processed data in the "Processed Data" folder.

Notes
It is important to ensure that the raw data is correctly organized in the subfolders corresponding to the days of the experiments.
Verify that the data processing script is correctly configured and that all necessary dependencies are installed.
