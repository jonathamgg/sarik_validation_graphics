Experiments and Data

This repository contains the raw data from experiments conducted on three different metrics, 
separated into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2). Each group has ten subfolders corresponding 
to the days when the experiments were conducted.

How to Use

Within each subfolder corresponding to a specific day, there are specific scripts for each tested variable. 
By running these scripts, a series of files will be generated at the end of the execution. 
These files contain the raw data from the experiment and need to be processed for further analysis.

Folder Structure

/Group1: Contains the subfolders corresponding to the days of experiments conducted in Group 1.
/Group2: Contains the subfolders corresponding to the days of experiments conducted in Group 2.
Within each subfolder of Groups 1 and 2, there are subfolders corresponding to the tested 
variables and their respective scripts.

/apt: Contains the specific script for apt and the files generated after running the script (apt.sh).
/apt: Contains the specific script for apt in Group 2 and the files generated after running the script (apt.sh).
